As of November 2016, 51.3% of all web visits have come from mobile devices compared to the 48.7% of visits from a computer. Society has
been moving towards a decidedly mobile-orientated world for a while now and mobile usage is rising faster than most people assumed
(Heisler, 2016). This shows that there is no way that designers can just design web pages for one platform.

To figure out the best approach to the project/design this report investigates the different components that responsive web design 
is formed by. This will include grid layouts, images, typography, navigation, media queries and breakpoints and mobile first and 
accessibility.
