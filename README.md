# website_design_and_develpoment

As of November 2016, 51.3% of all web visits have come from mobile devices compared to the 48.7% of visits from a computer. Society has
been moving towards a decidedly mobile-orientated world for a while now and mobile usage is rising faster than most people assumed
(Heisler, 2016). This shows that there is no way that designers can just design web pages for one platform.

This project is a 6 page responsive website to show case a clients new business "Stevo Training". The website is about personal training, sports conditioning and sports massage. It includes responsive imahes and typography and different elements to suit different screen sizes for the best possible practise.

GitHub branching strategy:
The Git hub branching system allows a developer to design in a seperate area to the rest/main part of the website. This allows fcontent to be able to be created without messing up another other parts of the website and aslo it it is a lot easier to go back and change mistakes or edit the files.
The branching strategy for this website will be:
*master
-indexpage
-personaltraining
-sportscon
-sportsmas
-about
-contact

There will will be one branch for each web page so i can create them away from the main site therefore being able to go back and edit them at any point.
